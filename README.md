## Project Overview

This project explores the use of LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for fine-tuning the Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct large language model (LLM) to perform time-series forecasting. Specifically, we target forecasting the predator-prey dynamics governed by the Lotka–Volterra equations.

Using the LLMTIME framework, numerical time series data is encoded as text, allowing Qwen to make autoregressive predictions over future values. The model is trained and evaluated under strict compute constraints, with FLOPs accounting for all experiments.

Our results demonstrate that with efficient fine-tuning and thoughtful hyperparameter selection, instruction-tuned LLMs can accurately forecast nonlinear dynamical systems with strong long-range structure.

## Setup & Usage

All preprocessing, training, forecasting, evaluation, and plotting are performed via Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory. To reproduce the workflow:


1. Environment Setup

```bash
    python3 -m venv M2_venv
    source M2_venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Launch Notebooks

```bash
    jupyter notebook notebooks/
```


3. Notebook Workflow

Use the notebooks below to explore the training and evaluation stages. Check their configured data and model paths before running; forecasting and evaluation require the relevant trained model.

## Use of Generative AI

- I used GitHub's Copilot to help me automatically finish off some code blocks and also to quickly docstring my functions.
- I used LLMs (ChatGPT) to help me create professional looking plots and occasionally to help me debug errors when I implemented something incorrectly.
